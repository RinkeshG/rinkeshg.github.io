# Hello World üëã  

I'm **Rinkesh Gorasia**, and welcome to my little corner on the Internet.  

Some titles I associate with ‚Äî **founder**, **author**, **researcher**, **speaker**, and **batman**.  

Exploring computers from the age of 12, I delved into the world of technology through **MS-DOS**, igniting my passion for the command line. As I explored various tech stacks, I became enamored with the idea of using technology to solve global challenges.  

I'm in the arena trying stuff. Some will work, some won't, but I'm always learning. *IYKYK*  

**Twitter** is my digital playground.
